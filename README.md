This project aimed to identify the optimal location for a public hospital in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires through a multicriteria evaluation using QGIS software.
<br>
<br>
To determine the optimal location for the public hospital in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires, several criteria were taken into account, including the population distribution, existing hospitals and health units, proximity to railway stations, distance from the main street of the town and the highway, and the location of the Avellaneda Ecological Reserve.

### The data sources used in this project were:

✔️ Shapefile with population density distribution.

✔️ Shapefile with hospital locations.

✔️ Shapefile with health unit locations.

✔️ Shapefile with railway station and track locations.

✔️ Shapefile with main street locations.

✔️ Shapefile with highway locations.

✔️ Shapefile with ecological reserve location.

✔️ Shapefile of the Avellaneda district.

### The criteria for selecting the hospital location were:

✔️ The location must be in a sector with a population density of more than 50 inhabitants per hectare.

✔️ It should be at a distance greater than 1500 meters from other hospitals.

✔️ It should be located at a distance greater than 500 meters from other health units.

✔️ It should be within 2000 meters of a train station.

✔️ It should be within 3000 meters of the highway.

✔️ It should be within 3000 meters of the main street.

✔️ It should be at a distance greater than 500 meters from the ecological reserve.

### Feature:

✔️ Simple and eye-catching poster consisting of Introduction, Factors Considered, Results, Conclusions, and Bibliography sections.

✔️ Introduction: Provides information on the data used, criteria considered, and a map indicating the location of Avellaneda.

✔️ Factors Considered: Illustrates maps of population density and location of hospital, health units, railway stations and tracks, main road, highway, and ecological reserve.

✔️ Results: Exhibits a map highlighting the areas in the Avellaneda district that satisfy all the mandatory criteria.

✔️ Conclusions: Emphasizes that QGIS was a proficient tool for conducting a multicriteria evaluation to determine the ideal site for the hospital.
