This project aimed to identify the optimal location for a public hospital in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires (see Figure 1) through a multicriteria evaluation using QGIS software.
<br>
<br>
To determine the optimal location for the public hospital in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires, several criteria were taken into account, including the population distribution, existing hospitals and health units, proximity to railway stations, distance from the main street of the town and the highway, and the location of the Avellaneda Ecological Reserve.

### The sources of data used in this project were:

✔️ Terrestrial coverage Shapefile.

✔️ Seabed coverage Shapefile.

✔️ Cardisoma guanhumi corridors Shapefile.

✔️ Stations Shapefile with information on benthic fauna diversity.
 
✔️ Sula dactylatra nesting sites Shapefile.

✔️ Fregata magnificens nesting sites Shapefile.

✔️ Tursiops truncatus shapefile.

✔️ Benthic fish richness sites Shapefile.

✔️ Roads Shapefile.

✔️ Station table with reports on the Marine Water Quality Index.

### The requirements that the proposed Marine Protected Area had to meet were::

✔️ At least one sector identified by its high concentration of nesting sites for marine bird species (Sula dactylatra and Fregata magnificens) and three Cardisoma guanhumi crab corridors must be conserved.

✔️ The conserved area must represent all natural ecosystems, especially coral reefs, seagrasses, mangroves, rocky shores, and coastal lagoons.

✔️ At least two of the top five sites with the highest fish richness (benthic fish grids) must be conserved.

✔️ At least two seabed areas with high records of benthic fauna diversity must be conserved.

✔️ Do not include stations with "Poor" category reports and, as far as possible, avoid stations with "Inadequate" category reports according to the Marine Water Quality Index.

✔️ The conserved area must be more than 100 meters away from roads and more than 150 meters away from urbanized areas.

✔️ The conserved area must be between 400 ha and a maximum of 2000 ha in size.

### Feature:

✔️ A map of the proposed Marine Protected Area, which incorporates information on terrestrial and marine coverages, as well as roads.

✔️ A dashboard that provides an overview of the representativeness of each ecosystem within the protected area through a pie chart and a map, along with the area's size in hectares. The dashboard is designed to be both simple and visually appealing. 

✔️ A geodatabase, containing three datasets: the first one includes layers and inputs used in the Marine Protected Area determination process, the second one consists of coverages and road layers, and the third one includes the proposed Marine Protected Area.

✔️ A justification for the Marine Protected Area's delimitation, along with conclusions regarding the usefulness of ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online for the project, as well as future recommendations.
